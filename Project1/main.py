        This function is the most simple pair trading strategy that I will develop in this project.
        It is based on the full sample (look ahead bias for sure) and does not provide any backtesting of any sort
        The flaws are pretty straightforward, the whole analysis is based on alpha and beta measures of the whole sample
        which is not realistic : If we trade in 2013, we should have values estimated on the sample available until now, 
        not on the whole sample. It is useful however to familiarize myself with the different concepts and
        serves as a building block for what I will do subsequently. 

        The spread is the residual series defined as the difference between the observed value of asset A 
        and the equilibrium predicted value based on asset B. When this difference between what we should observe
        based on the long-term relationship and what we do observe diverges, this is where we enter a trade.  
         
        When this relation goes back to normal (spread is 0 again), we get out of the opened positions. 

        Based on recent litterature, an optimal value to enter a trade would be when the normalized spread 
        goes above |1.5|, then we enter the trade. 

        When the spread is >> 0, it means that asset A is overvalued (or asset B is undervalued), it should be 0 however it diverges from its 
        value and the spread is positive. This means that we should short asset A and long asset B because based on the statistical properties 
        of the spread, its value should revert and decrease in the coming times (or B increases). If the spread is <<0, the invert 
        takes place

        In this framework, we lever the mean-reverting property of the stationarity of the spread's time series. 

        Size of the position : P_a = alpha + beta P_b + epsilon --> epsilon = P_a - alpha - beta P_b
        Therefore, if spread > 1.5 : invest 1 in -P_a and beta in P_b, if spread < -1.5 : invest 1 in P_a and beta in -P_b

        So, summary of when we enter or exit : 
        Enter : 
            1) short_A, long_B (A overpriced, B underpriced) : If spread > 1.5 AND positions not opened already 
            2) long_A, short_B  If spread < -1.5 AND positions not opened already 
        Exit : 
            - If positions opened AND spread changes sign (crosses y = 0)

    Transition  : [alpha_t, beta_t]^T = [alpha_{t-1}, beta_{t-1}]^T + omega_t,  omega_t ~ N(0, Q)
